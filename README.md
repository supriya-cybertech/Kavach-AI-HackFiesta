## 📌 Project Overview

**Kavach AI** is a high-impact Streamlit web application built for global social good. It analyzes suspicious messages and screenshots to help users identify online scams—*without using technical jargon*—and adapts its communication based on the user’s country, language, and cultural context.

Instead of sounding like a cybersecurity tool, Kavach AI behaves like a **trusted family member or personal guardian**, guiding users calmly and clearly through risky digital situations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Online scams are a **global problem** affecting millions every day. People fall victim not because they lack intelligence, but because:

- Scam messages create fear and urgency  
- Technical explanations are confusing  
- Help is not immediate, personal, or localized  

**Kavach AI solves this by combining AI intelligence with human empathy and cultural awareness.**
